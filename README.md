# Ajax Crash

## What is Ajax
- Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
- Set of web technologies
- Send and receive data asynchronously
- Does not interfere with current web page
- JSON has replaced XML for the most part

## XmlHttpRequest (XHR) Object
- API in the form of an object
- Provided by the browser's JS environment
- Methods transfer data between client/server
- Can be used with other protocols than HTTP
- Can work with data other than XML (JSON, plain text)
